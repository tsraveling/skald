    * [ ] Get Skald binary into place such that it can be updated as Skald itself does
    * [ ] R: Should a "Skald Interface" go module be its own module?
    * [ ] Write the C interface if needed
    * [ ] If so, make a new repo for it
    * [ ] Import the schema as needed from C++ into Go
- LSP Introduction
    * [ ] Add position tracking to the parser
- TUI Tester
    * [ ] Import Skald via the Go interface module
    * [ ] Show state in the right column
    * [ ] Continue vs choice input paradigm implement
    * [ ] I can get the initial text
    * [ ] I can continue with spacebar
    * [ ] I can select a choice with the number keys or cursor
    * [ ] Improve designs
    * [ ] Test and refine
