@define introParagraph

    Note: Any variables will be assumed to be present in the 'state' object passed in the optional argument in Skald. If a variable is not found, the value 'ERR' will be used instead.

    A line of plaintext will be returned as part of the result, verbatim, with no mutation. A newline is treated like a space unless it is the final one.
    An optional can be defined using brackets. One of the following will be chosen: [option a / option B]
    You can also include conditionals: [(pickerSwitch): option a / option b]. Note: If there's no option available, ERR will be returned.
    A conditional will only be included if the passed state requirement is met: { (shouldShowInclude): Inserted text }
    An insert is inserted as-is: {insert}

    If you want **Markdown** to work, you'll have to process the text through a third-party library.

    A pick statement is used to choose randomly from a longer list of options. A conditional can be placed at the beginning of the line to allow for greater filtration.
    Note: Skald will trim whitespace off the front and end of a line. Indentation is not required, but may help script readability.

    @endpick

    @pick

        - First option
        - Second option
        - (pickerSwitch): Positive optional
        - (!pickerSwitch): Negative optional
        - (pickerSwitch, secondSwitch): multi-argument optional
        - (pickerSwitch, !secondSwitch): multi-argument including negative optional
        - (specificValue=aValue): equality check -- note lack of quotes etc
        - (specificValue!=aValue): inequality check

    @endpick

    A pick statement ends when there are no more '- ' lines.

    Note: Newlines like the one above are ignored. To pass an actual newline, used the standard escape: \n

    A switch statement takes an argument from the passed state object and provides separate answers based on the value. default: defines a default value in the absence of the value options given.
    Failure to pass a default option will result in an ERR value if the condition is not met.

    @switch(switchValue)

        1: The answer was one
        2: The answer was two
        3: The answer was three
        default: There was some other answer.

    @endswitch

    As with the pick statement, a switch statement ends when a line does not begin with the `someKey: result` pattern.

    Finally, to try this out, set up a Skald object on this file and run `skaldExample.perform('introParagraph', state)` with the values found in the example App.js file.
