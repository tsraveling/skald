-- Test comment

#test_block

First beat

Second beat with an {injection}.

This one has a normal ternary, and {some_flag ? "yarrrrr!" : "narrrrr."} is the result.

Switch ternary: {pet_type ? [1: "cat", 2: "dog", 3: "camel"]}

This is a normal text block with some ops on it
  -> some_transition
  ~ some_var = another_var

-- This is a logic beat
*
  -> to_park
  ~ subtract -= 5

-- This is a one-liner:
* :someMethod(a, b)

Third {-- with inline comment} test

-- (? :method_check() and !:arg_check(a, b, c)) This one is conditional with a truthy value!
-- (? check_val and !falsy_check and (more_check > 10 or less_check <= 9)) This one is a combo clause
-- (? !check_val) This one shows up if check val is not true
-- (? val_a and val_b and val_c and val_d) This one checks a long and clause.

some_tag: This one is attributed!

-- (? eq_check = some_other_val) some_tag: this is a conditional attributed beat
