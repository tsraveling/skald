Today, you think you might just have found it.

What's your physical build?

> Wiry and agile
  ~ build = 1
> Tall and muscular
  ~ build = 2
> Compact and dangerous
  ~ build = 3

What's your academic specialty?

  ~ specialty = 2
> Arcane Engines
  ~ specialty = 3

* (? specialty = 3 or specialty = 2)
  ~ money = 100 -- TODO: do this with an incrementer

* (else)
  ~ money = 500

Your money is ${money}.

What tool do you have with you?

> A revolver
  ~ tool = 1

  ~ orphan = false

Excellent. You chose {build}, {specialty} and {tool}. Also, you {orphan ? "are" : "are not"} an orphan.

You are {build ? [1:"wiry", 2:"muscular", 3:"compact"]}. You studied {specialty ? [1:"linguistics", 2:"architecture", 3:"arcane engines"]}. In your satchel is a {tool ? [1:"revolver", 2:"whip", 3:"spade"]}.

That's it, for now.
