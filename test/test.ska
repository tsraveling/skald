#intro

First, let's play a chess game. If we win, we'll continue. Otherwise we'll move to the loss block.

opponent: Ready, bro?

How did it go? (the next beat is a logic beat with a method query)

* (? :did_win_chess())
  -> win

You lost! Such a shame.

> Try again -> intro
> I'm done.

opponent: Goodbye, compadre.
  EXIT

#win

You won!

opponent: Good game, friendo.
  EXIT
